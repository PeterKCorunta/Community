            Since its inception in 2000, COMMUNITY has proven to be the the repository of records
            of past artifacts and civilizations of African countries with its goal of promoting 
            seemingly lost and viable cultures, goals and values of past centuries. A wise man once
            said that the education of the youth is the beginning of government. In COMMUNITY, the idea
            is to engage the youths to seek as well as interpret the moral and intellectual significance
            of valuable historical records for their best educational interests.</p>
